# // DestinyVenture
> 5 month solo/team project
 
## **|| Introduction ||**
Destiny Venture is a first person, dungeon crawler, adventure, RPG, designed as an end of year project for NSCC game development concentration.

I want thank the developers that had helped out during a short development period for the 5 week NSCC capstone in May 2018. 
Special thanks as well to Case-EO from the UK for their mentoring during those 5 weeks on the project!

I had designed and created this title in February 2018 to the end of April 2018, which I had joined up with 3 other developers and expanded this game with more levels, enemies, and assets. Everyone had ended their work on the project at the end of May 2018 but after graduation I had continued development by added new features and polished every aspect of the game and ended development on July 17th 2018.

This game is 5 months old.
